# SumOfArray
Features:
Summing Array Elements:
Uses a standard for loop to iterate through array elements.
Uses an enhanced for loop (for-each loop) for simpler iteration.

Custom Input:
Users can input an array of integers.

Error Handling:
Handles empty arrays gracefully.

Requirements:
Programming Language: Java

Input:
An array of integers.

Output:
The sum of the array elements.

Usage:

Input:
Define an array of integers.

Processing:
Use a for loop and an enhanced for loop to calculate the sum.

Output:
Displays the sum of the array elements.

Algorithm:

Using For Loop
Initialize sum = 0.
Use a for loop to iterate through each element in the array.
Add each element to sum.
Print the final sum.

Using Enhanced For Loop:
Initialize sum = 0.
Use a for-each loop to iterate through array elements.
Add each element to sum.
Print the final sum.
